#### <a id="k19">k 19</a>

The K19 submarine was the first ballistic-missile equipped nuclear submarine, carrying carried three ballistic missiles with a range of 650km. During its first mission as a US attacker on June 18, 1961, the submarine experienced testing pressure that exceeded its designed pressure at ==Abrosimov Bay=={flyto:Q39265625,7}, resulting in damaged piping in the primary cooling unit. This led to a drop in pressure, causing the reactor water to boil and the reactor room temperature to reach 140Â°C, resulting in a fire. 

With no coolant system in place, the crew had to fix the leak using raincoats and gas masks. They managed to develop an effective cooling system with a drinking water supply, preventing fuel melting and a steam explosion. However, they were exposed to high levels of radiation, approximately ==50-60 Sv (5000-6000 rem)=={description="According to the International Commission on Radiological Protection, 1 Sv results in a 5.5% probability of eventually developing fatal cancer based on disputed linear no-threshold model of ionizing radiation exposure"}. Eight crew members who fixed the leak died within days. After replacing the reactor units, the K19 submarine was put back into use, but 22 out of the original crew of 139 died due to radiation exposure. [^2] 


#### <a id="k27">k 27</a>

K-27 was sent off on a five-day trip to conduct checkups for a 70-day mission, collecting data on two experimental liquid metal-cooled reactors, which featured a new design intended for the Soviet army. The goal was to have the first USSR submarine remain submerged for 50 consecutive days. 

However, the system had a tendency to leak steam, leading to oxidation of the liquid metal coolant and necessitating regular clean-up. A coolant failure occured, possibly caused by the accumulation of oxide particles, resulting in overheating and the release of radioactive gas into the engine room. The submarine resurfaced at ==Novaya Zemlya=={flyto:Q80413,7}This incident led to the deaths of nine individuals and the poisoning of all 144 crew members. [^4] 

#### <a id="Texas-radiological-assault">Texas radiological assault</a>

A man from ==Harris County, Texas=={flyto:Q26676,7}had deliberately exposed his 11-year-old son to radiological material on multiple occasions, resulting in serious consequences. The man had obtained capsules of ==Cesium 137=={description="a radioactive isotope commonly used in medical devices, gauges, and also produced as a byproduct of nuclear weapons and reactors. It is worth noting that approximately 27 kg of Cesium 137 was generated during the Chornobyl disaster.[^5]"} and used under 5-7 occasions, placing it inside headphones, pillows and cushions used by the son. In 1973, a plastic surgeon diagnosed the boy's skin lesion as being radiation-induced, confirming the harmful effects of the exposure. 

As a result, the boy had to undergo 16 operations between 1974 and 1978, including numerous skin grafts and castration.[^7] 

#### <a id="Tammiku-Stolen-Source">Tammiku Stolen Source</a>

Three brothers stole Cesium 137 from a nuclear waste factory in ==Tammiku, Estonia=={flyto:Q1356491,7}. One of the brothers placed the stolen metal block in his jacket pocket. He was hospitalized within 4 days and passed away just two days later, with the cause of death determined to be kidney failure, showing no signs of radiation injury. Unaware of the danger, the victim's stepson placed the metal in a kitchen drawer. After eight days, he too was hospitalized, and radiation burns were detected on his body. The authorities were promptly notified. 

The man who carried the stolen source home received a dose of 183,000 rads to his thigh and a whole-body dose of 4,000 rads. Other family members also received whole-body doses ranging from 100 to 400 rads. Tragically, even the family dog, which slept near the metal, succumbed to the radiation exposure and died.[^8] 

#### <a id="Guangzhou-radiological-assault">Guangzhou radiological assault</a>

A radiology scientist based in ==Guangzhou, China=={flyto:Q16572,7} used Iridium 192 pellets to target his colleague and former business partner. With forged documents, the scientist obtained an industrial machine containing Iridium 192 and enlisted an accomplice to help. They installed the machine above the ceiling panels in the victim's office and activated it when the victim was present.After approximately two months, the victim began to suspect a connection between his deteriorating health and radiation exposure. 

The primary victim was exposed to a dose ranging from 70 to 150 rads, while an additional 78 hospital staff members were also injured.[^10]  

#### <a id="San-Jose-Radiotherapy-incident">San Jose Radiotherapy incident</a>

The ==San Jose=={flyto:Q3070,7}  Radiotherapy incident in 1996 involved a significant error in a Cobalt 60 radiotherapy unit, leading to overdosages of approximately 60%. This incident resulted in the deaths of 7 to 17 individuals, although there were debates regarding whether the deaths were caused by the radiotherapy exposure or the underlying illnesses themselves. Additionally, 81 individuals suffered injuries as a result of the overexposures. [^11]   

#### <a id="Orphaned-source-in-Goiania-Brazil">Orphaned source in Goiania Brazil</a>

An abandoned radiotherapy unit in a demolished clinic in ==Goiania Brazil=={flyto:Q83189,7} contained a highly dangerous source of Cesium 137, amounting to 1375 curies. Two individuals dismantled the equipment and sold the source to a local junkyard, unknowingly spreading the radioactive material.

A number of people examined the material closely, took parts of it home, and distributed it among their families. Some even applied it directly to their skin. Certain components were sold to a second junkyard. Initially, doctors misdiagnosed the resulting illnesses as tropical diseases, but later suspected radiation as the cause. Fortunately, a medical physicist intervened and prevented firefighters from disposing of the substance in a nearby river. Authorities were alerted, and areas of contamination were identified. Treatment centers were established in the Olympic stadium to care for the injured. 

Approximately 112,800 people were examined, with 129 individuals sustaining injuries and 20 requiring hospitalization. There were five deaths and numerous injuries, including radiation burns, with some individuals needing amputations of fingers. [^13]   

#### <a id="Castle-Bravo-Nuclear-testing">Castle Bravo Nuclear testing</a>

During the Castle Bravo nuclear testing in 1954 as part of the United States' Operation Castle at ==Bikini Atoll=={flyto:Q152225,7}, prototypes of the first weaponized thermonuclear weapons were tested. The initial shot, codenamed "Shrimp" TX-21, was expected to have a yield of 6 megatons but in reality yielded 15 megatons.[^15] A Japanese fishing boat just outside the restricted zone unknowingly received the fallout. The 23 crew members were unaware of the hazardous nature of the material and did not take precautions to minimize their contact with it. Some crew members even tasted the substance. 

As a result, all crew members were hospitalized, and aggressive blood transfusions were administered after the captain recognized the sickness. One person died as a result of the exposure. 246 islanders residing on islands west of Bikini under US jurisdiction were exposed to the fallout and were evacuated two days later. Some islanders inadvertently ingested the fallout. Later in life, these islanders exhibited a high frequency of thyroid anomalies. 37 US naval personnel experienced beta burns from the fallout.[^16] 

#### <a id="SL-1-Reactor-excursion">SL-1 Reactor excursion</a>

The SL-1 reactor was a prototype reactor designed for easy assembly in remote locations.The reactor was water moderated and controlled by five aluminum-clad cadmium control rods. While three workers were reassembling the control rod drives on Jan 3 1961, one worker manually removed the center control rod rapidly over a 0.5-second period, causing the reactor to become supercritical. This resulted in a steam explosion with a total energy release of 1.3 x 108 joules, comparable to 30 kg of TNT. The worker who withdrew the rod was killed instantly by a control rod. The other two workers were burned and thrown by the explosion, with one dying instantly from impact and the other succumbing to head injuries and dying a few hours later. The release of radioactive material was largely contained within the building.
High radiation levels delayed emergency respondersâ entry into the reactor building. The bodies of the deceased workers were recovered on January 4 and January 9. In total, 22 personnel and responders received radiation doses ranging from 3 to 27 rads.[^17]

## powerplant failures: consequences and responses 
#### <a id="3-mile-island">3-mile island</a>
##### Overview 

On March 28, 1979, the Unit 2 reactor at Three Mile Island, located near Middletown, Pennsylvania, experienced a partial meltdown. This incident is widely considered as the most significant accident in the history of commercial nuclear power plants in the United States despite its limited radioactive releases. It initiated significant changes made in aspects of nuclear power plant operations and regulations, including emergency response planning, reactor operator training, human factors engineering, and radiation protection. 
##### Events in Sequence

At around 4 a.m., the accident originated in the non-nuclear part of the plant, affecting one of the two reactors. A failure, either mechanical or electrical, caused the main pumps to stop supplying water to cool the reactor. This led to the shutdown of the turbine-generator and the reactor itself. While the pressure in the nuclear piping system started to rise, a relief valve at the top of the pressurizer that should have closed got stuck open. Unfortunately, the control room instruments indicated that the valve was closed, and the staff was unaware that steam was escaping from the open valve, causing a loss of coolant. Alarms and warning lights alerted the operators, but they did not realize the severity of the situation.

Under normal circumstances, the pressure vessel containing the reactor core in the nuclear power plant was always filled with water. There was no need for a water-level instrument to indicate whether the core was adequately submerged. Therefore, the plant staff wrongly assumed that as long as the water level in the pressurizer was sufficient, the core would also be adequately covered. 

Unaware of the relief valve being stuck open and unable to confirm the water coverage of the core, the staff made a series of decisions that exposed the core. The malfunctioning valve caused a significant decrease in the pressure of the primary system, resulting in the reactor coolant pumps vibrating and being shut off. To avoid an undesirable situation where the pressurizer would be completely filled with emergency cooling water, the flow of water was reduced. Without the circulation of water by the reactor coolant pumps and with a scarcity of emergency cooling water in the primary system, the water level in the pressure vessel declined, leading to overheating of the core.
##### What Went Wrong?

The partial meltdown and minor off-site releases of radioactivity were caused by a combination of equipment malfunctions, personale errors, regulatory laxities, and operational issues.
- Equipment malfunction: The pilot-operated relief valve stuck open when it should have closed when the pressure fell to proper levels.
- Personale Error:  Plant operatorsâ was misled by the instruments in the control room which indicated that the valve was closed and failed to identify the valve was actually stuck open. 
- Regulatory Laxity: The closure of valves for routine maintenance was a violation of a key NRC rule. Once the secondary feedwater pumps stopped, three auxiliary pumps activated automatically but the valves had been closed for routine maintenace, the system was then unable to pump any extra water in this accident.
- operational issue: Reactor No. 2 had been rushed into service on the last day of 1978 since the utility company would have lost a $40 million federal tax break if waited one day more.
##### Aftermath

In spite of serious damage to the plant, most of the radiation was contained and the actual release have a negligible effect on the physical health of individuals.

No acute radiation injuries occurred, and the evidence indicates no chronic radiation injuries resulted. No individual chronic injuries can be attributed to the TMI accident; even claims of statistically observable changes in possible chronic effects (such as cancer) are not consistent with the evidence. Maximum possible dose to any individuals near the plant was about 0.02 to 0.07 rem in the case of a few hundred individuals, which is well below natural background radiation levels. No consistent evidence that radioactivity released during the nuclear accident has had a significant impact on the overall mortality.

The TMI accident resulted in significant property damage for the plant operator, but no injuries resulted. The main impact of the Three Mile Island accident has been psychological rather than physical.

##### Impact on Nuclear Industry

Despite the incident at TMI being a significant cause for the American public's distrust in nuclear industries in the decades to follow, it led to widespread changes across the U.S. commercial nuclear industry that improved regulations and practices. 

The NRC was strengthened and the industry established the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) to ensure appropriate training, plant management and operations. It expanded its resident inspector program in which two NRC inspectors live near each of the plants and provide oversight of adherence to the agenciesâ regulations. It also expanded both safety and performance-oriented inspections and established an operations center staffed 24 hours a day to provide assistance in plant emergencies. 

Training reforms are among the most significant outcomes of the TMI-2 accident. Training became centred on protecting a plant's cooling capacity, whatever the triggering problem might be. Events of TMI led to the establishment of the Atlanta-based Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) and its National Academy for Nuclear Training. Close to half of the operators' training was in a full-scale electronic simulator of the TMI control room. The $18 million simulator permitted operators to learn and be tested on all kinds of accident scenarios.

#### <a id="Fukushima-Daiichi">Fukushima Daiichi</a>
##### Overview

On March 11, 2011, Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami induced a disaster in northeastern Japan and initiated a severe nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. The tsunami inundated about 560 km2 and resulted in a human death toll of about 19,500 and much damage to coastal ports and towns, with over a million buildings destroyed or partly collapsed. The tsunami inundated about 560 km2 and resulted in a human death toll of about 19,500 and much damage to coastal ports and towns, with over a million buildings destroyed or partly collapsed.

The reactors proved robust seismically, but vulnerable to the tsunami. Power, from grid or backup generators, was available to run the residual heat removal (RHR) system cooling pumps at eight of the eleven units, and despite some problems they achieved 'cold shutdown' within about four days. The other three, at Fukushima Daiichi, lost power at 3.42 pm, almost an hour after the earthquake, when the entire site was flooded by the 15-metre tsunami. Three employees at the Daiichi and Daini plants were killed directly by the earthquake and tsunami, but there have been no fatalities from the nuclear accident.

##### Could it Have Been Prevented?

Unlike Chernobyl and TMI, it has often been argued that the unfortunate placement of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant saw tsunamis at a scale that was unforseen and therefore could not be prevented. 

The tsunami countermeasures taken when Fukushima Daiichi was designed and sited in the 1960s were considered acceptable in relation to the scientific knowledge then, with low recorded run-up heights for that particular coastline. But 18 years before the 2011 disaster, new scientific knowledge had emerged about the likelihood of a large earthquake and resulting major tsunami of some 15.7 metres at the Daiichi site. This, however, did not lead to any major action by either the plant operator, Tepco, or government regulators, notably the Nuclear & Industrial Safety Agency.

The methods used by TEPCO and NISA to assess the risk from tsunamis lagged behind international standards
- Historical Evidence of Disasters: TEPCO and NISA did not give sufficient attention to historical evidence of large earthquakes and tsunamis in the region surrounding the plant. 
- Tsunami Modeling Procedures: There appears to have been deficiencies in the tsunami modeling procedures used by TEPCO. Most importantly, TEPCO did not follow up with sufficient alacrity on preliminary 2008 simulations that suggested the tsunami risk to the plant had been seriously underestimated.
- NISA Inattentiveness: Â  NISA failed to review simulations conducted by TEPCO and to foster the development of appropriate computer modeling tools.Â 
##### Fukushima Now: Water Discharge

Japan announced in April 2021 that it planned to discharge more than 1.25 million cubic metres of treated water stored at the station by discharging it into the sea. The plan was approved by the nuclear regulator in early 2022. The water stored at the tanks at the Fukushima-Daiichi site is treated through a process known as advanced liquid processing system (Alps) to remove most of the radioactivity. Tritium, which cannot be removed by Alps, and some very low levels of other radionuclides, remain in the water after processing.

The water was largely used to cool the three damaged reactor cores, which remain highly radioactive. Some of it has since leaked into basements of the reactor buildings but was collected and stored in tanks. Space for the tanks is running out and the long-term management of the treated water is necessary to allow for the further decommissioning of Fukushima-Daiichi, which has been permanently shut down.

IAEA director has announced that his agencyâs âcomprehensive, neutral, objective and scientifically soundâ evaluation showed that the planned discharge was consistent with global industry and safety standards while its report was âneither a recommendation nor an endorsementâ of Japanâs water discharge decision.
