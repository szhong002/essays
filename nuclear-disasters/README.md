#### <a id="k19">k 19</a>
The K19 submarine was the first ballistic-missile equipped nuclear submarine, carrying carried three ballistic missiles with a range of 650km. During its first mission as a US attacker on June 18, 1961, the submarine experienced testing pressure that exceeded its designed pressure at ==Abrosimov Bay=={flyto:Q39265625,7}, resulting in damaged piping in the primary cooling unit. This led to a drop in pressure, causing the reactor water to boil and the reactor room temperature to reach 140°C, resulting in a fire. With no coolant system in place, the crew had to fix the leak using raincoats and gas masks. They managed to develop an effective cooling system with a drinking water supply, preventing fuel melting and a steam explosion. However, they were exposed to high levels of radiation, approximately ==50-60 Sv (5000-6000 rem)=={description="According to the International Commission on Radiological Protection, 1 Sv results in a 5.5% probability of eventually developing fatal cancer based on disputed linear no-threshold model of ionizing radiation exposure"}. Eight crew members who fixed the leak died within days. After replacing the reactor units, the K19 submarine was put back into use, but 22 out of the original crew of 139 died due to radiation exposure. 


#### <a id="k27">k 27</a>
K-27 was sent off on a five-day trip to conduct checkups for a 70-day mission, collecting data on two experimental liquid metal-cooled reactors, which featured a new design intended for the Soviet army. The goal was to have the first USSR submarine remain submerged for 50 consecutive days. However, the system had a tendency to leak steam, leading to oxidation of the liquid metal coolant and necessitating regular clean-up. A coolant failure occured, possibly caused by the accumulation of oxide particles, resulting in overheating and the release of radioactive gas into the engine room. The submarine resurfaced at ==Novaya Zemlya=={flyto:Q80413,7}This incident led to the deaths of nine individuals and the poisoning of all 144 crew members.

#### <a id="Texas_radiological_assault">Texas radiological assault</a>
A man from ==Harris County, Texas=={flyto:Q26676,7}had deliberately exposed his 11-year-old son to radiological material on multiple occasions, resulting in serious consequences. The man had obtained capsules of ==Cesium 137=={description="a radioactive isotope commonly used in medical devices, gauges, and also produced as a byproduct of nuclear weapons and reactors. It is worth noting that approximately 27 kg of Cesium 137 was generated during the Chornobyl disaster."} and used under 5-7 occasions, placing it inside headphones, pillows and cushions used by the son. In 1973, a plastic surgeon diagnosed the boy's skin lesion as being radiation-induced, confirming the harmful effects of the exposure. As a result, the boy had to undergo 16 operations between 1974 and 1978, including numerous skin grafts and castration. 

#### <a id="Tammiku Stolen Source">Tammiku Stolen Source</a>
Three brothers stole Cesium 137 from a nuclear waste factory in ==Tammiku, Estonia=={flyto:Q1356491,7}. One of the brothers placed the stolen metal block in his jacket pocket. He was hospitalized within 4 days and passed away just two days later, with the cause of death determined to be kidney failure, showing no signs of radiation injury. Unaware of the danger, the victim's stepson placed the metal in a kitchen drawer. After eight days, he too was hospitalized, and radiation burns were detected on his body. The authorities were promptly notified. The man who carried the stolen source home received a dose of 183,000 rads to his thigh and a whole-body dose of 4,000 rads. Other family members also received whole-body doses ranging from 100 to 400 rads. Tragically, even the family dog, which slept near the metal, succumbed to the radiation exposure and died. 

#### <a id="Guangzhou radiological assault">Guangzhou radiological assault</a>
A radiology scientist based in ==Guangzhou, China=={flyto:Q16572,7} used Iridium 192 pellets to target his colleague and former business partner. With forged documents, the scientist obtained an industrial machine containing Iridium 192 and enlisted an accomplice to help. They installed the machine above the ceiling panels in the victim's office and activated it when the victim was present.After approximately two months, the victim began to suspect a connection between his deteriorating health and radiation exposure. The primary victim was exposed to a dose ranging from 70 to 150 rads, while an additional 78 hospital staff members were also injured. 

#### <a id="San Jose Radiotherapy incident">San Jose Radiotherapy incident</a>
The ==San Jose=={flyto:Q3070,7}  Radiotherapy incident in 1996 involved a significant error in a Cobalt 60 radiotherapy unit, leading to overdosages of approximately 60%. This incident resulted in the deaths of 7 to 17 individuals, although there were debates regarding whether the deaths were caused by the radiotherapy exposure or the underlying illnesses themselves. Additionally, 81 individuals suffered injuries as a result of the overexposures. 

#### <a id="Orphaned source in Goiania Brazil">Orphaned source in Goiania Brazil</a>
An abandoned radiotherapy unit in a demolished clinic in ==Goiania Brazil=={flyto:Q83189,7} contained a highly dangerous source of Cesium 137, amounting to 1375 curies. Two individuals dismantled the equipment and sold the source to a local junkyard, unknowingly spreading the radioactive material. A number of people examined the material closely, took parts of it home, and distributed it among their families. Some even applied it directly to their skin. Certain components were sold to a second junkyard. Initially, doctors misdiagnosed the resulting illnesses as tropical diseases, but later suspected radiation as the cause. Fortunately, a medical physicist intervened and prevented firefighters from disposing of the substance in a nearby river. Authorities were alerted, and areas of contamination were identified. Treatment centers were established in the Olympic stadium to care for the injured. Approximately 112,800 people were examined, with 129 individuals sustaining injuries and 20 requiring hospitalization. There were five deaths and numerous injuries, including radiation burns, with some individuals needing amputations of fingers. 

#### <a id="Castle Bravo Nuclear testing">Castle Bravo Nuclear testing</a>
During the Castle Bravo nuclear testing in 1954 as part of the United States' Operation Castle at ==Bikini Atoll=={flyto:Q152225,7}, prototypes of the first weaponized thermonuclear weapons were tested. The initial shot, codenamed "Shrimp" TX-21, was expected to have a yield of 6 megatons but in reality yielded 15 megatons. A Japanese fishing boat just outside the restricted zone unknowingly received the fallout. The 23 crew members were unaware of the hazardous nature of the material and did not take precautions to minimize their contact with it. Some crew members even tasted the substance. As a result, all crew members were hospitalized, and aggressive blood transfusions were administered after the captain recognized the sickness. One person died as a result of the exposure. 246 islanders residing on islands west of Bikini under US jurisdiction were exposed to the fallout and were evacuated two days later. Some islanders inadvertently ingested the fallout. Later in life, these islanders exhibited a high frequency of thyroid anomalies. 37 US naval personnel experienced beta burns from the fallout.
