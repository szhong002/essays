This Juncture essay illustrates the use of a few Markdown formatting tags and the incorporation of an image and a map into a Juncture essay.

## Aulacophora indica

.ve-media wc:The_Bug_Peek.jpg right

The image depicts a leaf beetle (Aulacophora indica) (Family: Chrysomelidae; subfamily: Galerucinae) looking out from a leaf hole of Alnus nepalensis tree. Adult leaf beetles make holes in host plant leaves while feeding. They camouflage themselves with these holes.

Image information can be seen when hovering the cursor over the info icon located in the top-right corner of the image.  The Image information popover includes the image title, description, attribution statement, and reuse rights.

## Chitwan National Park, Nepal

.ve-map Q1075023 right

The map is centered on the Chitwan National Park in Nepal, which is the location associated with the image above.  The Wikidata identifier for Chitwan National Park is `Q1075023`.  When a map location is specified using a Wikidata ID (or QID) Juncture can automatically retrieve the geographic coordinates for map centering.

An alternative to using a Wikidata identifier for map positioning is to use regular latitude and longitude coordinates.  In that approach the QID would be replaced with the coordinates `27.5,84.333`, resulting in an identical map.
